# CS-330 3D Scene
 Final Project
 Logan Riedell

How do I handle software design? Before beginning any coding, I approach developing software by first identifying the requirements, then dissecting the problem into smaller components, then figuring out the architecture.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? Especially in the context of building 3D worlds and controlling various object features, my project helped me get better in designing modular and reusable code.

What design process did you follow for your project work? Beginning with a simple layout and adding more detail and functionality as the project developed, I followed an iterative design process.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? Any future project can benefit from the modular design approach I employed, which facilitates management and update of intricate systems.

How do I approach developing programs? I approach software development first designing the general framework, then creating and testing each little components before combining them into the whole program.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? I concentrated on maximizing the code for performance and applied more sophisticated approaches for handling fabrics and materials.

How did your development incorporate iteration? Iteration was essential; I constantly tested and improved every element of the scenario, changing the design depending on what worked best and what did not.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? With more of an emphasis on planning before coding and frequent testing to guarantee each component operated as planned, my method grew more methodical and effective.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? Whether in software development or another tech industry, computer science gives me the technical understanding and problem-solving ability required to produce original solutions.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?  In disciplines including game design, virtual reality, and instructional technologies, computational graphics and visualizations have helped me to produce visually appealing content valuable knowledge.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?  These abilities increase my capacity to contribute creatively and technically in these fields since they are essential for sectors including gaming, simulation, and user interface design that call for interactive and interesting digital experiences.
